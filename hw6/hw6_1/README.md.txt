# HW 6 Problem 1

**Write a C++ (or Java) program called hw6_1.cpp (or hw6_1.java) to conduct the radix sort.**
1. Sample Run 0: Assume that a user typed the following lines

5
77 23 17 5 12

The first line (= 5 in the example) indicates that there are five numbers in the second line (= 77, 23, 17, 5,
and 12 in the example) for the sorting.

This is the correct output. Note that your program should present the intermediate steps of the radix sort.

12 23 5 77 17
5 12 17 23 77

2. Sample Run 1: Assume that the user typed the following lines

12
9 87 199 15 3 214 19 26 58 2 102 23

This is the correct output.

2 102 3 23 214 15 26 87 58 9 199 19
2 102 3 9 214 15 19 23 26 58 87 199
2 3 9 15 19 23 26 58 87 102 199 214
